- AWS Organization backup policies are part of aws Backup and define backup plans for resources (EBS volumns, RDS) across accounts
- Cloudwatch Logs is not supported resource type for AWS backup
- Backup policies are for snapshot or point-in-time backups, not continuous log streaming to S3
- S3 bucket policy is irrelevant for log delivery (cloudwatch logs uses kinesis or subscription  filters, not direct S3 write)
